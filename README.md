# plugindependencies
Project provides both command line and Eclipse UI for static package, plugin and feature dependencies analysis (the dependencies are read from MANIFEST.MF and feature.xml files).

The project is started as student work from Oliver Broesamle.

The main goals for the command line:
  * Fast & lightweight
  * No 3rd party dependencies
  * Can be used during build & deploy process
  * Can analyse package & feature dependencies
  
The main goals for UI:
  * Fast & lightweight
  * Useful for analysis of huge target platforms
  * Easy navigation 
  * Easy discovery of platform issues
